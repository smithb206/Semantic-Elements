  <h1><strong>Semantic-Elements</strong></h1>
  <p>A <em>Semantic Web</em> allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities.
     And simply put, a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer.
  </p>
  <p>Semanti-Elements are primarily used to enhance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>accessibility -help assistive technologies read and interpret your webpage</li>
    <li>searchability - help computers make sense of your content</li>
    <li>internationalization - only 13% of the world are English native speakers</li>
    <li>interoperability - help other programmers understand the structure of your webpage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of non-semantic elements would be "div" and "span". These tags tell nothing about its content.</p>
  <p>Examples of semantic elements could be: "form", "table", and "article". These clearly define its content for both the browser and developer.</p>
